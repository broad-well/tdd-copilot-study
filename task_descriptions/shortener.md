# URL Shortener

Please write an API for a class named `URLShortener` that implements the conceptual interface of a URL shortener website like [is.gd](https://is.gd). Users should be able to shorten new links, look up shortened links, list the shortened links they've made, check the number of visits to each shortened link, etc.

The API can be written in plain text. It should include a list of public method headers, their arguments, and a short description of what each method does.
