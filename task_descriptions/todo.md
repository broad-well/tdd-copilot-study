# To-Do List Manager

Please write an API for a class named `TodoList` that manages a to-do list ordered by due date. You should be able to add/remove items from the list, and modify existing items. 

The API can be written in plain text. It should include a list of public method headers, their arguments, and a short description of what each method does.
