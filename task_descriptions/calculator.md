# Prefix Calculator

Please write an API for a class named `PrefixCalculator` that implements a prefix calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, and integer division `/`). The calculator uses a stack-based approach to evaluate the prefix expression. For instance, "* 4 5" evaluates to 20. 

The API can be written in plain text. It should include a list of public method headers, their arguments, and a short description of what each method does.
